# Training of JTVAE

There are 2 ways to train the model. Gradient Ascent requires JTVAE jointly trained with an auxiliary network that predicts properties (**JTVAE with properties**).

## Without properties

For training JTVAE **without** the auxiliary network of predicting properties (**JTVAE without prop**): Please follow the instruction in `TrainingJTNNVAE.md`

## With properties

For training JTVAE **with** the auxiliary network of predicting properties (**JTVAE with prop**): Please follow the instruction in `TrainingJTPROPVAE.md`
